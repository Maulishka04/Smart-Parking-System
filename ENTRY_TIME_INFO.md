```

### 2. **When Exiting a Vehicle (Receipt)**

```

```

### 4. **In Persistence Files**
Entry times are saved in `data-c/parking_state.csv` and `data-c/transactions.csv` for record-keeping.

## 🎯 Current Behavior

- Entry time = **Current system time** when vehicle is parked
- Entry time is **automatically recorded**
- Entry time is **immediately shown** to user
- Duration is calculated from entry to exit
- Billing is based on actual time parked

## 💰 Billing Example

**Scenario:**
1. Park a Car at 10:00 AM
   - Entry time: 2025-10-17 10:00:00
2. Exit at 11:30 AM
   - Duration: 90 minutes → rounds to 2 hours
   - Fee: ₹40 (first hour) + ₹20 (second hour) = ₹60

## 🔄 Testing Real Billing

To test different durations:

**Option 1: Wait Between Operations**
```
1. Park vehicle
2. Wait 5-10 minutes
3. Exit vehicle
→ Will show actual duration and minimum fee
```

**Option 2: Modify CSV Manually (Advanced)**
```
1. Park vehicle
2. Exit program
3. Edit data-c/parking_state.csv
4. Change entryTime to an earlier timestamp
5. Restart and exit vehicle
→ Will calculate based on modified time
```

**Option 3: Multiple Sessions**
```
Session 1: Park vehicles
Session 2 (next hour): Exit vehicles
→ Will show 1+ hour duration and proper fees
```
